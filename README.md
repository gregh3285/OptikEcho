# Interferometer

This is a piano emulator.  Interferometer is just a name that's unique.  I started working on this shortly after I finished Dr. Aspect's Coursera course on quantum optics for single photons.  It stuck.

Piano simulation is difficult.  At this point, this module is probably only sufficient for using it as a tool in the context of other work.  I've pushed George Winston midi files at this.  They do okay.  But, it's not a Steinway, by any means.

## Credits

Many of the ideas and some of the basic structure of this module come from the work of Karl Hiner.  He has a [piano simulation notebook](https://github.com/khiner/notebooks/blob/master/physical_audio_signal_processing/chapter_9_virtual_musical_instruments_part_2.ipynb) that was crucial in helping get this to where it is.
